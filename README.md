## Checking messages loaded in Postgres
- To validate the messages loaded in Postgres
```bash
psql -d postgres -U postgres -p 5432 -h localhost -W
```
- Credentials and database information
    - **username**=`postgres`
    - **password**=`postgres`
    - **database**=`postgres`

- If `psql` binary is not installed on Ubuntu based distros, install it using the below command.
```bash
apt install postgresql-client
```

## Decrypting masked PIIs
- The `ip` and `device_id` fields are masked using base64 encryption.
- To recover the encrypted fields, we can use the below command.
```bash
echo -n "<sample_base64_encrypted_string>" | base64 --decrypt
```
